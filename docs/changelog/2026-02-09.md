# February 9, 2026 - Infrastructure & Deployment

## Domain Migration
- Migrated frontend from `www.aledlie.com/tcad-scraper/` to custom domain `alephatx.info` (GitHub Pages + Cloudflare)
- Set Vite `base` from `"/tcad-scraper/"` to `"/"` for root domain deployment
- Configured DNS: `alephatx.info` (GitHub Pages), `www.alephatx.info` (cert provisioning), `api.alephatx.info` (Cloudflare Tunnel)

## Fixes
- Fixed Cloudflare SSL mode (Flexible) for Hobbes origin on port 80
- Restarted nginx on Hobbes (had been failed since Feb 6)
- Re-provisioned GitHub Pages HTTPS cert (was expired/stuck in `bad_authz`)
- Created missing Prisma migration `20251201000000_add_year_column` (year column existed in schema/prod but had no migration)
- Fixed CI deploy: added `npm rebuild` after `npm ci` for rollup native module on Linux

## Stale File Cleanup
- Deleted `server/docs/TEST-SEPARATION-STRATEGY.md` — superseded by `docs/TESTING.md` (referenced stale Jest config, wrong test counts)
- Deleted `server/fallbackBrowserSearch/` — experimental code, not imported anywhere; production scraper has built-in Playwright fallback
- Deleted `dev/RESUME-HERE.md` — stale session handoff doc (Nov 2025, `new-ui` branch, 138 tests)
- Integrated `GTM-SETUP-GUIDE.md` — GTM measurement ID `G-ECH51H8L2Z` added to README.md and `docs/ANALYTICS.md`
- Integrated `ATTRIBUTION-COMPONENTS.md` — attribution component docs merged into `docs/ANALYTICS.md` (Attribution Components section)

## Docs
- Updated CLAUDE.md infrastructure section, debugging table, access points
