## 🚀 Test Suite Statistics

```
Test Suites: 3 failed, 1 skipped, 10 passed, 13 of 14 total
Tests:       28 failed, 1 skipped, 263 passed, 292 total
```

**Pass Rate**: 90% (263/292 tests passing)

### Test Distribution

- **Passing Tests**: 263
- **Failed Tests**: 28 (mostly due to external service dependencies)
- **Skipped Tests**: 1
- **Total Test Files**: 14

---

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### 1. Jest Configuration

**File**: `jest.config.js`

**Change**: Re-enabled route tests by removing:
```javascript
'/src/routes/__tests__/',  // ← Removed this line
```

**Impact**: Added 22 route tests back into the test suite

### 2. Token Refresh Service Tests

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Mocked Playwright's `chromium` module
- Mocked `node-cron` for scheduling
- Tested lifecycle methods without browser automation
- Focused on logic, statistics, and error handling

**Key Tests**:
- ✅ Constructor initialization
- ✅ Token getter methods
- ✅ Statistics tracking
- ✅ Health check methods
- ✅ Auto-refresh lifecycle (start/stop)
- ✅ Cleanup and resource management
- ⚠️ Browser-based token capture (partial - complex async handling)

### 3. Route Test Integration

**Success**:
- App routes testing HTML rendering
- Security headers (nonce, CSP)
- JSON-LD structured data
- SEO meta tags

**Challenges**:
- Property routes have Claude API dependencies
- Queue operations require Redis connection
- Some tests need service mocking improvements

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Coverage Journey

| Date | Coverage | Improvement | Milestone |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Baseline | 5.46% | - | Initial state |
| 2025-11-08 AM | 11.67% | +114% | Phase 1 complete |
| 2025-11-08 Noon | 17.91% | +53% | Property controller complete |
| **2025-11-08 PM** | **29.56%** | **+65%** | **Phase 2 nearly complete** |

### From Baseline to Current

- **Starting Point**: 5.46%
- **Current**: 29.56%
- **Total Improvement**: +441% (5.4x increase)
- **Tests Added**: 211 new tests (81 → 292 total)

---

## 🎯 Remaining to Reach Phase 2 Goal (35%)

**Gap**: 5.44 percentage points

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Fix failing route tests** (~2-3% potential)
   - Mock Redis/Bull queue in property route tests
   - Fix Claude API mock in natural language search tests

2. **Add partial TCAD scraper tests** (~2-3% potential)
   - Test helper methods (getRandomElement, humanDelay)
   - Test configuration initialization
   - Test browser cleanup methods

3. **Test metrics service basics** (~2-4% potential)
   - Mock Prometheus client
   - Test metric registration
   - Test basic counter/gauge operations

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours to reach 35%

---

## 🚧 Challenges Encountered

### 1. Module-Level Initialization

**Problem**: Services that initialize connections at module load time are difficult to mock:
- Redis cache service
- Bull queue
- Sentry service

**Impact**: These require integration testing or complex Jest module mocking

**Solution**: Focus on testing pure logic and methods that don't require initialization

### 2. Browser Automation Testing

**Problem**: Playwright-based code is challenging to unit test
- TCAD scraper (653 lines)
- Token refresh service (partial)

**Impact**: Limited coverage on browser interaction code

**Solution**: Test configuration, helper methods, and error handling paths

### 3. External Service Dependencies

**Problem**: Some tests require real services:
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Redis (cache, queues)
- Claude API (AI search)

**Impact**: Tests fail without proper mocking or service availability

**Solution**: Comprehensive mocking strategy (see below)

---

## 💡 Testing Patterns Established

### 1. Service Testing with Playwright Mocking

```typescript
// Mock Playwright before imports
const mockBrowser = {
  newContext: jest.fn(),
  close: jest.fn(),
};

jest.mock('playwright', () => ({
  chromium: {
    launch: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(mockBrowser),
  },
}));

// Then import service
import { ServiceName } from '../service';
```

### 2. Config Mocking

```typescript
jest.mock('../../config', () => ({
  config: {
    setting: 'test-value',
  },
}));
```

### 3. Route Testing

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import request from 'supertest';

const app = express();
app.use('/', router);

const response = await request(app).get('/');
expect(response.status).toBe(200);
```

## 📚 Documentation Created

### Session Documents

1. **This File**: Complete session summary
2. **Updated**: `docs/TEST-STATUS.md` with new coverage numbers
3. **Testing Patterns**: Documented in this file for future reference

---

## ✨ Key Learnings

1. **Incremental Progress Works**: Small, focused improvements compound quickly
2. **Route Tests Are Valuable**: Re-enabling route tests added 8% coverage
3. **Focus on Testable Code**: Pure logic functions have highest test ROI
4. **Mock Judiciously**: Some services are better tested via integration
5. **Test Statistics Matter**: Even partial service coverage (54%) adds value

---

## 🎯 Next Session Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (to reach 35%)

1. **Fix Failing Tests** (Priority: High)
   ```bash
   # Focus on these test files:
   - src/services/__tests__/token-refresh.service.test.ts (5 failures)
   - src/routes/__tests__/property.routes.claude.test.ts (needs mocking)
   ```

2. **Add Helper Function Tests** (Priority: High)
   - TCAD scraper: `getRandomElement()`, `humanDelay()`
   - Token service: Additional error paths
   - Estimated: +2-3% coverage

3. **Metrics Service Basics** (Priority: Medium)
   - Mock Prometheus registry
   - Test metric creation
   - Estimated: +2-4% coverage

### Medium-term Goals (to reach 70%)

4. **Queue Operations** (Priority: Medium)
   - Mock Bull queue properly
   - Test job processing logic
   - Estimated: +5-6% coverage

5. **Redis Cache Service** (Priority: Low)
   - Solve module initialization mocking
   - Or use integration tests
   - Estimated: +8-10% coverage

6. **TCAD Scraper** (Priority: Low)
   - Focus on parsing and data extraction
   - Mock browser page responses
   - Estimated: +10-15% coverage
